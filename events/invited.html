  <div class="title">BOUNDING BANDWIDTH</div>
  <div class="abstract">
    Given an ordering of the vertices of a graph G, its bandwidth is the maximum distance (in the ordering) between two adjacent vertices of G.
    The bandwidth of G is the minimum bandwidth of an ordering of the vertices of G.<br><br>
    What graphs have small bandwidth? Several examples of families of trees of unbounded bandwidth are known; and in 2014 Drego and Lokshtanov showed that every tree of high bandwidth contains as a subgraph a member of one of these families. In this talk we will extend this result to the class of all graphs, rather than just trees.<br><br>
    The proofs are algorithmic, and consequently we also get an FPT approximation algorithm for bandwidth.<br><br>
    <em>This is joint work with Daniel Lokshtanov and Eran Nevo.</em>

  <div class="title"> Riemannian planes and string graphs are quasi-isometric to planar graphs </div>
  <div class="abstract"> It is a folklore result that for every complete Riemannian surface S there is a countable locally finite graph G with positive real edge lengths that has an embedding in S so that the embedding is also a quasi-isometry between G and S. For complete Riemannian planes we strengthen this so that the edge lengths of the planar graph G are uniformly equal to 1. The proof is an application of a more technical combinatorial result which is also used to show for example that string graphs are quasi-isometric to planar graphs.
These results extend to higher genus surfaces and the condition that the Riemannian surface has bounded genus is necessary. We construct a complete Riemannian surface in which no such embedding of a graph that has edge lengths uniformly equal to 1 exists.
The talk assumes no knowledge of Riemannian geometry.</div>

  <div class="title">On better-quasi-ordering under graph minors</div>
  <div class="abstract">
    We prove that the finite graphs are better-quasi-ordered under the minor relation if and only if the countably infinite graphs with no infinite paths are well-quasi-ordered, which is a special case of a well-known conjecture of Thomas. We provide further equivalent statements and side results.

  <div class="title">Linear-Time Algorithms for k-Edge-Connected Components, k-Lean Tree Decompositions, and More</div>
  <div class="abstract">
    We present k<sup>O(k²)</sup> m time algorithms for various problems about decomposing a given undirected graph by edge cuts or vertex separators of size &lt;k into parts that are “well-connected” with respect to cuts or separators of size &lt;k; here, m is the total number of vertices and edges of the graph.
    An application of the results is a linear-time algorithm for computing the k-edge-connected components of a graph when k is constant, solving a long-standing open problem.
    The main technical result, from which the other results follow, is a k<sup>O(k²)</sup> m time algorithm for computing a k-lean tree decomposition of a given graph.
    This is a tree decomposition with adhesion size &lt;k that captures the existence of separators of size &lt;k between subsets of its bags.
    A k-lean tree decomposition is also an unbreakable tree decomposition with optimal unbreakability parameters for the adhesion size bound k.
    Our algorithm uses a generalized version of Bodlaender's matching contraction technique, and graph-theoretical techniques including the theory of tangles by Robertson and Seymour.<br><br>

  <div class="title">Vertex-minors and quantum computing</div>
  <div class="abstract">Given a graph $G$, there is a corresponding quantum state called $\ket{G}$ whose entanglement properties are dictated by $G$. There is a deep theory linking quantum properties of $\ket{G}$ back to combinatorial properties about the graph. This talk will primarily serve as an introduction to this area. We will also link back to recent and ongoing work about vertex-minors and graph immersions as we go. <br><br>

Much of this talk is based on joint work with Jim Geelen and Paul Wollan. Hopefully we also have time to speak about joint work with Donggyu Kim and Caleb McFarland.</div>

  <div class="title">On the Bidirected Cut Relaxation for Steiner Tree and Steiner Forest </div>
  <div class="abstract">The Steiner Tree problem is one of the most prominent network design problems. It asks to connect a given set of terminals in the cheapest possible way. A promising ingredient for the design of fast and accurate approximation algorithms is the bidirected cut relaxation (BCR). We prove that this linear programming relaxation has integrality gap less than 2.

We also consider the Steiner Forest problem, an important generalization of Steiner Tree. We describe a natural extension of BCR to Steiner Forest and prove that it has several promising properties.<br><br>

  <div class="number">7.</div>
  <div class="speaker">Kristina Vušković</div>
  <div class="title">The structure of (even hole, diamond)-free graphs</div>
  <div class="abstract">
    The structure of even-hole-free graphs has been studied since the late 90s. Structural results led to a polynomial-time recognition algorithm for even-hole-free graphs (Conforti, Cornuéjols, Kapoor, Vušković 1997).
    The two key computational problems that remain open on even-hole-free graphs are vertex colouring and the independent set problem.
    Kloks, Muller and Vušković obtained a tighter structural characterization of (even hole, diamond)-free graphs in 2007, that allowed them to colour this class in polynomial time.
    In this talk we present another structural study of (even hole, diamond)-free graphs, that allows us to show that the class has bounded tree independence number, which then implies that the maximum independent set problem can be solved on this class in polynomial time.<br><br>

<div class="talk">
  <div class="number">8.</div>
  <div class="speaker">Sebastian Wiederrecht</div>
  <div class="title">Current challenges in classic graph minor theory</div>
  <div class="abstract">
    In recent years many classic theorems and open problems rooted in Robertson and Seymour's theory of graph minors have seen major improvements and solutions.
    This talk consists of two parts: first, a survey about the current state of the art in terms of structure and algorithms; second, an overview of remaining long-standing open problems as well as more recent questions and possible directions for further development.
