  <div class="title">Asymptotic grid minors in quasi-transitive graphs</div>
  <div class="abstract">
Krön and Möller [2008] showed that every connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive graph $G$ that is not quasi-isometric to a tree contains the half-grid as a minor. <br><br>

In this talk I discuss how this result could be strengthened so that the half-grid minor appears in the coarse (“large-scale”) geometry of $G$. In particular, I present a result for accessible, locally finite, quasi-transitive graphs using asymptotic minors. I further discuss the possibility of finding even the full-grid as an asymptotic minor.
This is a first step towards classifying quasi-transitive graphs in terms of asymptotic minors. <br><br>

  <div class="title">An approximate Tutte-decomposition for all connectivities I: Capturing cyclic structure with flowers</div>
  <div class="abstract">
Every connected graph trivially decomposes along its cutvertices into 2-connected components. A classical theorem of Tutte from 1966 states that 2-connected graphs can be further decomposed into basic pieces that are cycles, and 3-connected pieces. For higher connectivity, no such decomposition was known until recently, when Carmesin and Kurkofka established a decomposition for 3-connected graphs in 2023. Interestingly, their basic pieces are wheels, which again have a cyclic structure. A recent extension of the Tutte-decomposition to 4-connected graphs by Kurkofka and Planken again produces basic pieces that exhibit a cyclic structure. As it is an open problem to extend the Tutte-decomposition to all connectivities, the crucial question arises whether we can expect the basic pieces of these decompositions to exhibit a cyclic structure? <br><br>

In this talk, we show that the answer is yes, and thereby make the first step towards a Tutte-decomposition for all connectivities. That is, we use coverings from topology to detect the cyclic structure of the basic building blocks for arbitrary connectivities, and then use flowers from connectivity theory to combinatorially capture those cyclic structures. We have used the flower-description of the basic building blocks to prove an approximate Tutte-decomposition for all connectivities, see the next talk. <br><br>

  <div class="title">Extending isomorphisms of subgraphs: interactions of model theory and combinatorics</div>
  <div class="abstract">
    Given a graph G (or more generally, a relational structure such as a digraph or hypergraph), a central question in model theory is under which circumstances isomorphisms of induced substructures of G can be extended to automorphisms of G, or how G can be extended to a larger structure in which such an automorphism exists. Perhaps surprisingly, such extensions often yield highly symmetric graphs, and algebraic methods can thus be used to understand and construct them. In my talk, I will give an overview of existing results and open problems in this area.

    It is known that there is a linear dependence between the treewidth of a graph and its balanced separator number: the smallest integer k such that for every weighing of the vertices, the graph admits a balanced separator of size at most k. We investigate whether this connection can be lifted to the setting of coarse graph theory, where both the bags of the considered tree decompositions and the considered separators should be coverable by a bounded number of bounded-radius balls.<br><br>
    As the first result, we prove that if an n-vertex graph G admits balanced separators coverable by k balls of radius r, then G also admits tree decompositions T₁ and T₂ such that:<br>
    • in T₁, every bag can be covered by O(k log n) balls of radius r; and<br>
    • in T₂, every bag can be covered by O(k² log k) balls of radius r(log k + log log n + 1).<br><br>
    As the second result, we show that if we additionally assume that G has doubling dimension at most m, then the functional equivalence between the existence of small balanced separators and of tree decompositions of small width can be fully lifted to the coarse setting.

  <div class="abstract">
    Consider the graph which is the disjoint union of all n-vertex planar graphs. This graph is planar and has 2<sup>O(n)</sup> vertices. We prove that any planar graph G that contains all n-vertex planar graphs as subgraph must indeed contain 2<sup>Ω(n)</sup> vertices, and the same holds even if G is only required to be K<sub>t</sub>-minor-free for fixed t. So the minimum size of such a graph G cannot be improved much compared to the trivial construction. This can be seen as a finite, quantitative counterpart of a result of Huynh, Mohar, Šámal, Thomassen and Wood (2021) for infinite graphs.<br><br>

  <div class="abstract">
    The dominating number γ(G) of a graph G is the minimum size of a vertex set whose closed neighbourhood covers all vertices of G, while the packing number ρ(G) is the maximum size of a vertex set whose closed neighbourhoods are pairwise disjoint.
    We investigate graph classes 𝒢 for which the ratio γ(G)/ρ(G) is bounded by a constant c<sub>𝒢</sub>, for every G ∈ 𝒢.
    Our approach is based on a new inductive proof technique, which can establish or improve bounds on this ratio for several families, including planar graphs, graphs of bounded treewidth, and graphs of bounded twin-width.
    We also present new examples of graph classes where the ratio is provably unbounded.<br><br>

  <div class="abstract">
    Let G be a graph on n vertices. Given two edges e and f in G, we say that a path P in G separates e from f if P contains e but not f. It is known that in every graph G there exists a family of only O(n) paths that together separate all edges of G from each other. Can the same bound be achieved using, instead of paths, another class of subgraphs? In this talk we answer this question affirmatively for families consisting of subdivisions of any fixed arbitrary graph H (and single edges).<br><br>

    We provide a unique decomposition of every 4-connected graph into parts that are either quasi-5-connected, cycles of triangle-torsos and 3-connected torsos on at most five vertices, generalised double-wheels, or thickened K<sub>4,m</sub>'s. The decomposition can be described in terms of a tree-decomposition but with edges allowed in the adhesion-sets. Our construction is explicit, canonical, and exhibits a defining property of the Tutte-decomposition.<br><br>
    As a corollary, we obtain a new Tutte-type canonical decomposition of 3-connected graphs into parts that are either quasi-4-connected, generalised wheels, or thickened K<sub>3,m</sub>'s.

    We consider the strong immersion relation on Eulerian digraphs. While it is not a well-quasi-order on all Eulerian digraphs, we show that it is one for Eulerian digraphs of maximum degree 4 which are Eulerian-embeddable into a fixed surface, and for those of bounded carving width. As applications, we obtain that bipartite circle graphs are well-quasi-ordered by the pivot minor relation and a polynomial-time algorithm for testing immersion-closed properties of Eulerian-embeddable graphs, as well as a characterisation of the Erdős–Pósa property for Eulerian digraphs of maximum degree four.<br><br>

  <div class="abstract">
    We study an extension of the k-Disjoint Paths Problem where, in addition to finding k disjoint paths joining k given pairs of vertices in a graph, we ask that those paths satisfy certain constraints expressable by abelian groups. We give an O(n⁸)-time algorithm to solve this problem under the assumption that the constraint can be expressed as avoiding a bounded number of group elements; moreover, our algorithm allows any bounded number of such constraints to be combined. The k=1 case of the problem with modularity constraints solves a problem of Arkin, Papadimitriou, and Yannakakis (1991).

  <div class="title">On a refinement of the list
chromatic index</div>
  <div class="abstract">
The list chromatic index of any graph G is at least its maximum degree
Delta(G), since edges incident to any vertex must receive distinct
colors. This is most evident when the lists are identical. However, it
is reasonable to expect that G is edge-colorable from lists of size less
than Delta(G), provided that the lists do not much "locally interfere".
There are several ways to make it precise. One approach, which we will
consider in our talk, is to bound the maximum number of edges incident
to any vertex whose lists have non-empty intersection, introduced by L.
Paterek and R. Kang in 2025.<br><br>

Given a graph G and a natural number d, the ultimate problem is to
determine the smallest number g(d) such that G is edge-colorable from
any edge-list assignment satisfying that (i) all lists have size at
least g(d) and (ii) the maximum number of edges incident to any vertex
whose lists have non-empty intersection is at most d. Trivially, g(d) >=
d. Our main result shows that, for a simple graph G, we have g(d) = (1 +
o(1))d, where o(1) is a term that goes to zero as d goes to infinity.
This partially generalizes the celebrated result of J. Kahn, which
states that the chromatic index and the list chromatic index of
multigraphs are asymptotically equal. Our proof is based on the simpler
proof of Kahn's result for simple graphs by M. Molloy and B. Reed.<br><br>

In our talk, we briefly discuss the proof of our main result. However,
main focus will be on presenting several new related open problems and
possible algorithmic applications of our results. This is joint work
with Ross Kang.

  <div class="title">H-Planarity and Parametric Extensions: when Modulators Act Globally</div>
  <div class="abstract">
    We introduce a series of graph decompositions based on the modulator/target scheme of modification problems. We define H-Planarity as the problem of deciding whether a graph G contains a vertex set X such that the torso of X is planar and the connected components of G−X are in H. We prove that, if H is hereditary, CMSO-definable, and decidable in polynomial time, then H-Planarity is solvable in polynomial time.<br><br>
    Additionally, we define two planar extensions of elimination distance to H and H-treewidth—namely H-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth—for which we find FPT results under mild assumptions on H.<br><br>
    Our results are the first to handle modulators that act globally. For this, we introduce a new version of the “irrelevant vertex technique” that deals with modulators that may act everywhere in the input graph.

Using the same techniques, we also prove that for any planar multigraph H, every binary matroid either has a minor isomorphic to the cycle matroid of kH, or is a low-rank perturbation of a binary matroid with no such minor.<br><br>

  <div class="abstract">
    Every connected graph decomposes along its cutvertices into 2-connected components. A theorem of Tutte (1966) states that 2-connected graphs can be further decomposed into 3-connected pieces, cycles and K₂’s. For higher connectivity, no such decomposition was known until recently, when Carmesin and Kurkofka established a decomposition for 3-connected graphs (2023), later extended to 4-connectivity by Kurkofka and Planken.<br><br>
    In this talk, we present an approximate version of Tutte’s decomposition that works for every k and every almost k-connected graph. Our decomposition is a tree-decomposition all whose torsos are either almost (k+1)-connected or flowers (with cyclic structure), and which displays all k-separations up to some constant error.<br><br>

    A vertex colouring φ of a graph G is p-centered if for every connected subgraph H of G, either φ uses more than p colours on H, or there is a colour that appears exactly once on H.

This improves on a non-explicit polynomial bound by Pilipczuk and Siebertz.

  <div class="title">A graph minors approach to temporal sequences</div>
  <div class="abstract">
    A temporal sequence is a sequence of graphs, each of which is obtained from the previous one via minor operations or the reversal of such operations. We develop a structural approach to simultaneous planarity in temporal sequences, inspired by graph minor theory. Our main result is a classification theorem for 2-connected temporal sequences: we identify five obstruction classes and show that every 2-connected temporal sequence is either simultaneously embeddable or admits a sequence of improvements leading to an obstruction. This structural insight leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding the simultaneous embeddability of 2-connected temporal sequences.
    The restriction to 2-connected sequences is necessary, as the problem is NP-hard for connected graphs but trivial for 3-connected graphs.<br><br>
    Our results uncover a rich structural theory of temporal planarity, laying the groundwork for a temporal graph minors theory.
