9.4.2024 <b>Roman Schaut (Hamburg) </b> Displaying prescribed sets of ends by linked tree-decompositions <br>
<br>
</li>

Abstract: Given a set of ends $\Psi$ in some graph that can be displayed by a tree-decomposition of finite adhesion, we give the construction of a linked, tight and componential tree-decomposition of finite adhesion that displays $\Psi$. <br><br>

<li>
16.4. <b>Andrew Paul Moorhead (TU Dresden) </b> Higher dimensional generalized quasiorders <br>
<br>
</li>


 Abstract: We are interested in clones on a finite set, where a (concrete) clone is a set of operations on some finite base set which is closed under composition and also contains all projection operations for every possible number of arguments. Clones have wide applications in mathematics, especially to algebra, the study of relational structures, and computational complexity theory (the so-called constraint satisfaction problem). Since clones have a wide scope of applicability, one correctly expects that their structure is complicated. Early in the 20th century, Post famously classified all of the clones on a two element set and provided a complete picture of their lattice order under containment. A detailed understanding of clones on finite sets with cardinality bigger than two remains a distant dream, since we know that in all other cases there are continuum many and the structure of this continuum is quite complicated.

Many of the deeper insights into clone theory are obtained via a Galois connection relating operations to sets of invariant relations. The fundamental concept which mediates this Galois connection is that of preservation. A classical result of Maltsev states that an equivalence relation is preserved by an operation if and only if it is preserved by all basic translations of the operation, which are unary operations obtained by substituting all variables but one for a constant. Hence, we ask the question: for which relations is it sufficient to check preservation by higher arity analogues of these basic translations? Building on independent work of each of the authors, we develop the general framework of Higher Dimensional Generalized Quasiorders in which the classical result of Maltsev can be viewed as a (1)-dimensional example.  <br><br>



<li>
30.4. <b>Maja Pech (University of Novi Sad) </b> Characterizing XY-homogeneity  <br>
<br>
</li>


 Abstract: The notion of homomorphism homogeneity was introduced in 2002 by Cameron and Ne≈°etril. A relational structure U is called homomorphism homogeneous if every local homomorphism of U can be extended to an endomorphism of U.
 The notion of XY-homogeneity introduced in 2014 by Lockett and Truss generalizes the notion of homomorphism homogeneity. A relational structure U is called XY-homogeneous if every homomorphism of type X between finite substructures of U can be extended to
 an endomorphism of U of type Y. Here X and Y refer to certain standard classes of morphisms such as homomorphisms, monomorphisms, endomorphisms, etc.

In this talk we use a notion of morphism classes X and Y that goes beyond the classification by Lockett and Truss. Our main results are two Fraisse-type theorems for XY-homogeneous structures, that extend and generalize
 the results by Coleman, Evans and Gray.  <br><br>

 Abstract:  The automatic continuity problem asks the following question: Given two topological groups $L$ and $G$ and an algebraic morphism $\varphi\colon L\to G$, can we find conditions on the groups $L$ and $G$ ensuring that $\varphi$ is continuous? In this talk we will give an introduction to this problem focusing on the case where $L$ is a locally compact Hausdorff group and $G$ is a geometric group. <br><br>

5.2.2025 <b>≈Ωaneta Semani≈°inov√° (Dresden) </b>: Valued Constraints over Infinite Domains   <br>
<br>
</li>

 Abstract:  Valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs) provide a framework for many optimization problems. A VCSP is parameterized by a valued structure (template), which consists of a domain and cost functions, each of them defined on finite tuples of elements from the domain. The input to the VCSP consists of a finite set of variables, a finite sum of cost functions applied to these variables, and a threshold u, and the task is to decide whether there exists an assignment to the variables so that the sum of the costs is at most u. VCSPs with finite templates are well-understood and exhibit a complexity dichotomy: each of them is in P or NP-complete. However, many important optimization problems, such as min correlation clustering or the minimum feedback arc set problem cannot be modelled as VCSPs over a finite template. In this talk, we give an introduction to the theory of infinite-domain VCSPs. We then present a complexity classification of VCSPs of all valued structures over the domain Q that are preserved by all order-preserving permutations. Finally, we sketch how resilience problems from database theory can be viewed as VCSPs and present some complexity classification results that this connection yields. This talk is based on joint work with M. Bodirsky, √â. Bonnet and C. Lutz. <br><br>

3.7.2024 <b>Will J. Turner</b>:  Local Separators of Cayley Graphs: Proof Strategy. <br>

 Abstract:  Stallings' Theorem (1971) states that a finitely-generated group splits
over a finite subgroup if its Cayley graphs have more than one end. In
2010, Bernhard Kr√∂n gave a short proof of Stallings' Theorem using separators of graphs. In this project, we move towards a finite version
of Stallings' Theorem using local separators. We show that a
finitely-generated group (with bounded nilpotency), having a certain
local separator in one of its Cayley graphs, is necessarily cyclic,
dihedral or decomposes as a direct product of a cycle and an involution.
In particular, we assume the existence of a d-local cutvertex or a
d-local 2-separator, for d bounded below in terms of the group's
nilpotency. A r-local cutvertex u in a graph is a vertex which
disconnects the subgraph induced on a ball of diameter d centred at u. A
d-local 2-separator is defined so that it works in a similarly intuitive
way. <br><br>

5.6.2024 <b>Paula Kahl</b>:  Introduction to amenability and related properties of groups. <br>

 Abstract:  Introduced by Gromov in the late 1990s, the notion of a sofic group turned out to be very fruitful. Within a short period of time several long-standing group-theoretic conjectures, such as Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture or Kaplansky's direct finiteness conjecture (both still open for arbitrary groups), were proved for sofic groups. This suggests to think of soficity as a strong property only few groups satisfy. However, until now, there is not a single group known to be non-sofic. Starting from the older and stronger notion of amenability, the talk provides an introduction to soficity, hyperlinearity and the Haagerup property, as well as the relations between them. In particular we are going to prove that amenability implies soficity. <br><br>

22.5.2024 <b>Will J. Turner</b>: Local Separators of Cayley Graphs: Towards a Stallings-Type Theorem for
Finite Groups.
 <br>

 Abstract:  Stallings' Theorem (1971) states that a finitely-generated group splits
over a finite subgroup if its Cayley graphs have more than one end. In
2010, Bernhard Kr√∂n gave a short proof of Stallings' Theorem using separators of graphs. In this project, we move towards a finite version
of Stallings' Theorem using local separators. We show that a
finitely-generated group (with bounded nilpotency), having a certain
local separator in one of its Cayley graphs, is necessarily cyclic,
dihedral or decomposes as a direct product of a cycle and an involution.
In particular, we assume the existence of a d-local cutvertex or a
d-local 2-separator, for d bounded below in terms of the group's
nilpotency. A r-local cutvertex u in a graph is a vertex which
disconnects the subgraph induced on a ball of diameter d centred at u. A
d-local 2-separator is defined so that it works in a similarly intuitive
way. <br><br>

15.5.2024 <b>Tim Planken</b>:  Colouring d-dimensional triangulations. <br>

 Abstract:  We consider d-dimensional triangulations and show structural equivalences for (d+1)-colourability and (d+2)-colourability of the vertices of such triangulations. In particular, we show that a d-dimensional triangulation admits a proper (d+1)-colouring if and only if every (d-2)-cell is incident with an even number of (d-1)-cells. Moreover, a d-dimensional triangulation C admits a proper (d+2)-colouring if and only if there exists a triangulation C' that contains C such that for every (d-2)-cell in C', the number of incident (d-1)-cells is divisible by three. <br><br>

8.5.2024 <b> Josefin Bernhard</b>:  Automatic continuity of topological groups. <br>

 Abstract:  Many concrete groups come equipped with a non-trivial compatible topology. In some natural examples of topological groups, the topology is determined already by the algebraic structure. Such situation is closely linked with the automatic continuity property: a topological group is said to have automatic continuity if every homomorphism from it into any separable topological group is continuous. In the talk, examples and applications of this phenomenon will be given and we will discuss methods of proving this property for a given group. <br><br>
